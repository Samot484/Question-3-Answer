This repository contains my answer to question 3 of the 3rd Year Biology Undergraduate GitHub Computer Assignment. The analysis included calculates the average rainfall by month in Melbourne and Oxford and then produces a graph comparing rainfall in each month.

To run the first section of the analysis use the following command:

```
Rscript src/combine-data.R
```

To run the second section of the analysis use the following command:

```
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```

The input data is in `data`, the results of the first section of code are in `out-combine-data`, the input for the second section of code is in `out-combine-data` and the results of the second section of code are in `out-make-plot`.
